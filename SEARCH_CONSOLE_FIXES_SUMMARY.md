# Google Search Console Issues - Fixed

## Date: September 14, 2025

## Issues Reported by Search Console
1. **Page with redirect**
2. **Alternate page with proper canonical tag**

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. Duplicate `/index/` Route (FIXED)
- **Problem**: The sitemap contained `https://penelopesboutiquevenue.com/index/` which duplicated the homepage
- **Cause**: A content file at `/src/content/pages/index.md` was being processed by the `[...slug].astro` dynamic route handler
- **Solution**: Updated `[...slug].astro` to filter out the `index` slug to prevent duplicate routes

### 2. WWW vs Non-WWW Mismatch (FIXED)
- **Problem**: Canonical URLs were using `www.penelopesboutiquevenue.com` while the site config uses `penelopesboutiquevenue.com` (without www)
- **Cause**: All canonical tags in content files incorrectly included the `www` prefix
- **Impact**: Google saw these as pointing to a different domain, causing canonical confusion
- **Solution**: Removed `www` from all canonical URLs across the site to match the site configuration

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Dynamic Route Handler
**File**: `/src/pages/[...slug].astro`
```javascript
// Added filter to exclude 'index' slug
const filteredPages = pages.filter(page => page.slug !== 'index');
```

### 2. Fixed Canonical URLs (29 files updated)
Removed `www` prefix from all canonical URLs:
- **Service Areas** (12 pages): All service area pages now have consistent canonical URLs
- **Holiday Pages** (5 pages): All holiday city pages properly point to the main holiday page
- **Seasonal Pages** (7 pages): All seasonal pages have correct canonicals
- **Other Pages** (5 pages): Christmas, New Year's, and seasonal wedding pages fixed

### Example Changes:
- Before: `canonical: "https://www.penelopesboutiquevenue.com/service-areas/denver/"`
- After: `canonical: "https://penelopesboutiquevenue.com/service-areas/denver/"`

## Verification Steps Completed
1. ✅ Rebuilt the site to verify changes
2. ✅ Confirmed `/index/` is no longer in the sitemap
3. ✅ Verified all canonical tags now use consistent non-www URLs
4. ✅ Checked that the homepage canonical is correct
5. ✅ Verified service area pages have proper self-referencing canonicals
6. ✅ Confirmed holiday pages consolidate to the main holiday page

## Next Steps

### 1. Deploy Changes
Deploy the updated site to production to apply these fixes.

### 2. Validate in Search Console
After deployment:
1. Go to Google Search Console
2. Navigate to "Page indexing" → "Why pages aren't indexed"
3. Find the issues:
   - "Page with redirect"
   - "Alternate page with proper canonical tag"
4. Click "Validate Fix" for each issue
5. Google will re-crawl and validate (typically takes 1-2 weeks)

### 3. Monitor Progress
- Check validation progress weekly in Search Console
- Monitor for any new indexing issues
- Verify organic traffic remains stable or improves

## Best Practices Applied

### Canonical URL Consistency
- All canonical URLs now consistently use `https://penelopesboutiquevenue.com` (no www)
- This matches the site configuration in `astro.config.mjs`
- Ensures Google understands the preferred domain format

### Duplicate Content Prevention
- Removed duplicate `/index/` route that was confusing search engines
- Properly consolidated similar content (holiday pages) to single canonical URLs
- Service area pages maintain unique canonicals for local SEO value

### Site Structure Clarity
- Clear hierarchy with proper canonical tags
- No conflicting redirects or duplicate routes
- Consistent URL structure throughout the site

## Technical Details

### Site Configuration
- **astro.config.mjs**: `site: 'https://penelopesboutiquevenue.com'` (no www)
- **Layout.astro**: Properly generates canonical tags from frontmatter or current URL
- **Sitemap**: Now excludes the problematic `/index/` route

### Impact on SEO
1. **Improved Crawl Efficiency**: Google won't waste crawl budget on duplicate pages
2. **Better Link Equity**: All link value consolidates to the correct canonical URLs
3. **Clearer Site Structure**: Search engines better understand your content hierarchy
4. **Reduced Indexing Errors**: Fixes the specific issues reported in Search Console

## Expected Timeline
- **Immediate**: Changes are live in the build
- **1-3 days**: Google will start re-crawling after deployment
- **1-2 weeks**: Full validation in Search Console
- **2-4 weeks**: Improved indexing and potential ranking improvements
