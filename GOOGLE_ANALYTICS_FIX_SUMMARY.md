# Google Analytics Fix Summary

## ✅ Problem Solved
Your local development traffic is NO LONGER being sent to Google Analytics!

## 🛡️ Two-Layer Protection

### Layer 1: Build-Time Check
- **Development Mode (`npm run dev`)**: GA script is NOT included at all
- **Production Build (`npm run build`)**: GA script is included BUT with hostname checking

### Layer 2: Runtime Domain Check (Production Builds Only)
Even if you build locally with `npm run build`, GA will NOT load unless the hostname is exactly:
- `penelopesboutiquevenue.com` OR
- `www.penelopesboutiquevenue.com`

## 🚫 GA is BLOCKED on:
- `localhost` (any port)
- `127.0.0.1` (any port)
- Local network IPs (`192.168.x.x`, `10.x.x.x`, `172.x.x.x`)
- `.local` or `.lan` domains
- Vercel preview deployments (*.vercel.app)
- Any other domain or IP

## ✅ GA ONLY Works On:
- `https://penelopesboutiquevenue.com` (production)
- `https://www.penelopesboutiquevenue.com` (production with www)

## 🧪 Testing Results

| Environment | GA Script Included? | GA Actually Loads? |
|------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| `npm run dev` (localhost) | ❌ No | ❌ No |
| `npm run build` (local preview) | ✅ Yes | ❌ No (blocked by hostname) |
| Production deployment | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes (only on production domain) |

## 📊 How to Verify

### Check Development Mode:
```bash
npm run dev
# Open browser console
# Should see: "🔍 Google Analytics: DISABLED (Development Build)"
# Network tab: NO requests to googletagmanager.com
```

### Check Production Site:
1. Visit https://penelopesboutiquevenue.com
2. Open browser console
3. Should see: "📊 Google Analytics: ENABLED (Production Domain)"
4. Network tab: Shows requests to googletagmanager.com

### Check Google Analytics:
- Real-time reports should ONLY show traffic from penelopesboutiquevenue.com
- No more localhost or development IP addresses

## 🔧 Technical Details

The fix uses a two-stage approach:

1. **Astro Server-Side**: Checks `import.meta.env.PROD` to determine if this is a production build
2. **Client-Side JavaScript**: Even in production builds, checks `window.location.hostname` to ensure we're on the production domain

This means you can safely:
- Develop locally without polluting GA
- Build and test locally without sending data to GA
- Deploy preview branches without affecting GA
- Only track real visitor data from your production site

## 🎉 Result
Your Google Analytics will now ONLY track real visitors to your production website!
