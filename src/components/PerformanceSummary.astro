  Performance Optimizations Summary - Astro Implementation
  ========================================================

  This file documents all the Astro-specific performance optimizations
  implemented for the Penelope's Venue homepage.

  âœ… COMPLETED OPTIMIZATIONS:
  ===========================

  1. View Transitions (astro.config.mjs)
     - Enabled experimental.viewTransitions: true
     - Provides smoother navigation between pages
     - Reduces perceived loading time

  2. Optimized Image Service (astro.config.mjs)
     - Sharp image service with custom configuration
     - Removed pixel limits for better quality control
     - Progressive JPEGs for faster loading
     - 80% quality balance between size/performance
     - Default constrained layout for responsive images

  3. Streaming Components (Multiple Components)
     - VenueStatsSection.astro - Streamable venue statistics
     - ServicesSection.astro - Streamable services list
     - AboutPreviewSection.astro - Streamable about section
     - TestimonialsSection.astro - Streamable testimonials
     - LocationCTASection.astro - Streamable contact section
     - Enables progressive loading and better LCP

  4. Content Collections (src/content/)
     - services.json - Service data management
     - testimonials.json - Testimonial data management
     - venue-stats.json - Statistics data management
     - Better performance and maintainability
     - Type-safe content management

  5. Incremental Static Regeneration (index.astro)
     - ISR with 15-minute revalidation
     - Fresh content without full rebuilds
     - Better performance for dynamic content

  6. MDX Optimization (astro.config.mjs)
     - Enabled MDX optimization for faster processing
     - Better build performance for content-heavy sites

  7. Compression & Build Optimizations (astro.config.mjs)
     - HTML compression enabled
     - Vercel compression enabled
     - Inline small stylesheets
     - Server-side rendering for better performance

  8. Performance Monitoring (REMOVED)
     - Core Web Vitals tracking removed
     - Navigation timing monitoring removed
     - Resource loading performance tracking removed
     - View transition performance monitoring removed

  9. Prefetching (astro.config.mjs)
     - Enabled prefetching for better navigation
     - Viewport-based prefetching strategy
     - Reduces navigation latency

  ðŸ“Š EXPECTED PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS:
  =====================================

  - Faster Initial Page Load: Streaming components
  - Better LCP Scores: Optimized images and progressive loading
  - Improved CLS: Proper image dimensions and loading
  - Enhanced Navigation: View transitions and prefetching
  - Better Caching: ISR for dynamic content
  - Reduced Bundle Size: Code splitting and optimization

  ðŸ”§ MONITORING & MAINTENANCE:
  =============================

  - Core Web Vitals are logged to console
  - Performance metrics available in browser dev tools
  - Regular monitoring recommended for ongoing optimization
  - Content collections make updates easier and safer

  This implementation follows Astro best practices for performance
  and provides a solid foundation for SEO-optimized, fast-loading pages.
