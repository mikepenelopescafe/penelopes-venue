# Content Creation Guidelines for Penelope's Venue

This file provides comprehensive guidelines for creating content that dominates local SEO while providing exceptional user value through problem-focused, accessible writing.

## Core Writing Standards

### 1. Reading Level: 8th Grade (Critical Requirement)

**Why This Matters:**
- Higher Google rankings for accessible content
- Better LLM (AI) comprehension and responses
- Wider audience reach and engagement
- Improved user experience across all education levels

**Implementation Rules:**
- **Sentence length**: 15-20 words average (max 25 words)
- **Paragraph length**: 3-4 sentences maximum
- **Word choice**: Simple, common words over complex alternatives
- **Voice**: Active voice preferred (90% of sentences)
- **Structure**: Use bullet points, lists, and headers for easy scanning

**Examples:**
```
❌ Complex: "Our establishment facilitates exceptional matrimonial celebrations."
✅ Simple: "We help couples plan amazing weddings."

❌ Long: "Penelope's Venue provides comprehensive event coordination services that encompass all aspects of planning, execution, and management for weddings, corporate events, and private celebrations throughout the Denver metropolitan area."
✅ Clear: "Penelope's Venue helps plan your perfect event. We handle weddings, corporate meetings, and private parties in the Denver area."
```

### 2. Problem/Question-Based Content Approach

**Core Principle**: Every piece of content must start with a customer problem or question.

**Why This Works:**
- Matches search intent perfectly
- Ranks higher in voice search and LLM responses
