## Colorado Wedding Venues on a Budget — Denver Metro's Best-Kept Secret

## Your Colorado Wedding Doesn't Need Mountain Venue Prices

Colorado wedding venues love to charge "destination pricing" even when you're just looking for a beautiful space in the metro area. At Penelope's, we believe Denver-area couples deserve better than $15,000 venue quotes.

## Why Penelope's Tops Colorado Budget Venue Lists

### Authentic Character Without the Markup
Our Spanish-inspired architecture brings the warmth and romance of a destination venue to Westminster. Original tiles, warm lighting, intimate spaces — expensive ambiance that's already built in.

- 20 minutes from Boulder
- Mountain views from our location
- Free parking (saving each guest $20–30)

### All-Inclusive Means Actually All-Inclusive
One venue. One kitchen. One bar. One bill. No vendor coordination headaches, no markup mysteries.
