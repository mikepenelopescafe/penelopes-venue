# Tier 2 Content Briefs: Event Types + City Enhancements

## Authoring Rules (must follow)

- primaryKeyword: unique site‑wide; do not duplicate any existing page
- intent: "commercial" for all briefs below (transactional CTAs allowed)
- dimension: use "occasion" for event pages; "city" for service area
- citySlug: omit for global event pages (to avoid duplicate intent|dimension|scope)
- canonicalOf: only set if making a variant that must canonicalize to an existing primary
- File location: `src/content/pages/...` for event pages; `src/content/service-areas/...` for city

### Westminster Hub (new)
- File Path: `/src/content/service-areas/westminster.md`
