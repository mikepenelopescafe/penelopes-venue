# Planning a Birthday in Westminster? Make It Yours

Are you celebrating a milestone birthday but don't want to host at home? You want somewhere special that can handle your guest list without breaking the bank.

Home parties get cramped fast. Restaurants are noisy and expensive. Hotel banquet rooms feel cold and impersonal. You need a space that feels warm and celebratory.

## Your Birthday Party Challenge  

Hosting a birthday party for 20-75 people is tricky. Your house is too small. Restaurants charge per person plus room fees. Public venues often double-book or have strict rules.

You want somewhere your guests can mingle comfortably. A place where you can play your music, bring your cake, and celebrate exactly how you want.

## Our Birthday Party Solution

Our Birthday Party Celebration package gives you everything needed for an amazing milestone celebration. We provide tables, chairs, sound system, and ambient lighting in a beautiful space.

You get 4 hours to party, plus extra time to decorate beforehand. Bring your own cake, decorations, and music. We handle setup and cleanup so you can focus on celebrating.

Your guests get plenty of free parking. The space is climate controlled year-round. And you have kitchen access for serving cake and refreshments.

## Common Birthday Party Questions

**Can we bring our own food and cake?**  
Absolutely! Most birthday parties bring their own cake and order catering or provide food buffet-style. We can recommend great local caterers too.

Bring whatever makes you happy! Balloons, banners, centerpieces - it's your party. Our sound system connects to phones or you can bring a DJ.

**How early can we come to decorate?**  
You get one hour before your event time to decorate and set up. That's usually plenty of time for most birthday decorations.

**Is there parking for all our guests?**  
Yes, free parking for 75+ vehicles right on site. No one has to hunt for street parking or pay for lots.

**Can we have a surprise party here?**  
Perfect! We've hosted many surprise parties. We can help coordinate timing and keep decorations hidden until the big moment.
