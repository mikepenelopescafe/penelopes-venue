# Planning a Big Wedding in Westminster? Here's Your Complete Solution

Are you dreaming of a full wedding celebration but feeling overwhelmed by all the details? You want your special day to be perfect, but coordinating everything seems impossible.

You're not alone. Most couples get stressed trying to handle venue, setup, coordination, and timing. There are so many moving parts to a full wedding.

## Your Wedding Planning Challenge

Planning a wedding for 50-100 guests means juggling countless details. You need ceremony space, reception area, parking, coordination, setup, and breakdown. Plus you want it all to flow seamlessly.

Many venues nickel-and-dime you with hidden fees. Others don't provide enough support. Some can't handle larger guest counts properly.

## Our Complete Wedding Solution

Our Full Wedding Celebration package handles everything for your big day. You get 8 hours of venue access, both ceremony and reception spaces, and complete coordination.

We set up your ceremony with seating and decor. Then we flip the space for your reception with dining tables, dance floor, and bar area. Our team handles it all while you're taking photos.
